		/**  The search results will be an ArrayCollection of matches from

		 *   Not all of the elements will always be present or have values.
		 *   The ID value will always be there.
		 *   
		 *   TODO: This will change when we rationalize the interface to
		 *    the ontology and term search to use OntologyReference and 
		 *    OntologyTermReference objects instead of generic ActionScript.
		 *    That will mean changing the interaction with the search and
		 *    update functions.
		 *    For the meanwhile, we will use the basic forms as returned
		 *    by the NCBO service as our representation.
		 * 
		 *   LIST_ONTOLOGIES:
		 *      ontologyId: An ID for the ontology.  This may be a universal
		 *                    id or relative to the search engine.
		 *      displayName: The name of the ontology for display purposes
		 *      shortName: An abbreviated name for the ontology
		 *      description: A description of the ontology (long)
		 *      versionNumber: A version number for the ontology.      
		 * 
		 *   FIND_ONTOLOGY_TERMS:
		 * 
		 *      termId:  An ID for the term.  This may be a universal
		 *                    id or relative to the ontology.
		 *      shortName:  A short version of the ID.
		 *      displayName: The preferred human readable name for the term
		 *      description: A longer description or definition of the term
		 *      ontologyId: An ID for the ontology.  This may be a universal
		 *                    id or relative to the search engine.
		 *      ontologyDisplayName: Ontology name for display purposes.
		 * 
		 *   SET_ONTOLOGY_IDS: Events dispatched by the search dialog based
		 *   ADD_ONTOLOGY_IDS: on the action buttons chosen.  For setting
		 *                     the ID sets the ontologyIds to only the currently
		 *                     selected set, replacing existing Ids.  Adding
		 *                     the IDs adds to the existing set.
