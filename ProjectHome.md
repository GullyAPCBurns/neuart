NeuARt is a digital atlasing system for viewing and analyzing spatial data registered onto digital atlases. In the current NeuARt implementation data consists on collections SVG images, one image per atlas plate, that are in complete agreement with atlas plates images. We call each one of these collections a data map. NeuArt can display several images side-by-side and superimposed on top of common atlas plates.
