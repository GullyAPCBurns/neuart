NeuARt README

- NeuARt makes use of the svgweb application. The svgweb (a descendent of SVGViewer) 
application is used to render svg images within a FLEX application. Currently, we 
have to build the svgweb binary ourself because the binary distribution of svgweb 
is not apt to be directly used within a FLEX application as a library. Instructions 
on how to get the source code and build the library are included in our SVGViewer
project.
